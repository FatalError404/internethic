# The templates currently attempt to work out the language to present the
# capture in based on the language_code attribute. This is currently not
# perfect (Will work on this) and you may want to override the automated
# language chosing and set a default value.
#
# If OverrideLang is set (not empty) then it will be used as the display
# language of the reCAPTCHA widget
#  Current possible values are:
#   English     en 
#   Dutch       nl
#   French      fr
#   German      de
#   Portuguese  pt
#   Russian     ru
#   Spanish     es
#   Turkish     tr

# Allows to use recaptcha only on newly created objects and to ignore it on objects that are re-edited.
# Usefull if you want to use recaptcha only for user/register and not on user/edit
# Another use would be to use recaptcha only when adding comments and not when editing them.
