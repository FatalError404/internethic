reCAPTCHA Module
===========================
reCAPTCHA is an extension that allows the integration of the reCAPTCHA
anti-spam CAPTCHA service in your eZ publish content objects.  reCAPTCHA
provides a reCAPTCHA datatype that can be used in editing content and
information collection. reCAPTCHA provides both text and audio CAPTCHAs.

About reCAPTCHA
---------------
Over 60 million CAPTCHAs are solved every day by people around the world.
reCAPTCHA channels this human effort into helping to digitize books from the
Internet Archive. When you solve a reCAPTCHA, you help preserve literature by
deciphering a word that was not readable by computers. 

reCAPTCHA is a project of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
University.

From: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/

API V2
----------------
Now this extension is by default the Api v2

Even if the version 1 is not used anymore at 2018 march 31, the old code has been kept for backward compatibility and to keep in mind the initial logic of the extension.

To use this extension with API V2
	1) Create keys from Google Recaptcha Admin interface
	2) Configure keys in recaptcha.ini file
	3) Clean invasive integration that impacts other extension in eZ Publish instance (ofr instance the recaptcha javascript used in pagelayout head)

To use Recaptcha in multi Mode
	1) Configure the recaptcha.ini file to define your keys according to your domains
	2) Configure single mode keys as empty string in order to use the keys defined as array domain keys, see below

		PublicKey=
		PrivateKey=
		PublicKey[domain-1]=public-key-domain-1
		PrivateKey[domain-1]=private-key-domain-1
		PublicKey[domain-2]=public-key-domain-2
		PrivateKey[domain-2]=private-key-domain-2
		PublicKey[domain-N]=public-key-domain-N
		PrivateKey[domain-N]=private-key-domain-N

		If you ommit to set key asempty string in single mode the configuration will use the default one in recaptcha erxtension (see default recaptcha.ini file, the used value in default provided configuration is 'Enter your Public Key here', which is a not valid default key)

		#PublicKey[hostname]=Enter your Public Key here for hostname
		#PublicKey[localhost]=Enter your Public Key here for localhost
		PublicKey=Enter your Public Key here

		#PrivateKey[hostname]=Enter your Private Key here for hostname
		#PrivateKey[localhost]=Enter your Private Key here for localhost
		PrivateKey=Enter your Private Key here
